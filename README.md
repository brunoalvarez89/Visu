Visu is the final project of my MSc. Eng. degree. It is a multi-channel Analog-to-Digital (ADC) data visualization tool.

With this program you can:
* Connect to an acquisition sensor over Bluetooth.
* Process, display and manipulate the data on the screen.
* Configure the visualization depending on the study type.
* Save data to local memory and Google Drive.
* Load and display saved data.
