Visu
====

Visu is the final project of my MSc. Eng. degree. It is a multi-channel Analog-to-Digital (ADC) data visualization tool.

With this program you can:
* Connect to an acquisition sensor over Bluetooth.
* Process, display and manipulate the data on the screen.
* Configure the visualization depending on the study type.
* Save the data to the local external memory and Google Drive.
* Load and display saved data.

The thesis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B72lvocrm-L4cG1NRmstbk1nZlU&authuser=0) (spanish).
