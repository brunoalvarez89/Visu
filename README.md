Visu is the final project of my career. It is multi-channel ADC data visualization tool. 


With this program you can:
* Connect to an acquisition sensor over Bluetooth.
* Process, display and manipulate the data on the screen.
* Configure the visualization depending on the study type.
* Save the data to the local external memory and Google Drive.
* Load and display saved data.
